# Minesweeper Game - Multimedia Subject

This repository contains the **Minesweeper Game** project developed as part of the **Multimedia** course in the **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at the **National Technical University of Athens**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a functional **Minesweeper game** using **Java**, implemented in **Eclipse IDE**. The project demonstrates the use of Java's object-oriented programming features, graphical user interface (GUI) design, and event handling for a classic interactive game.

## Game Features

- **Classic Minesweeper Gameplay**: Players attempt to clear a grid without detonating any mines.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced difficulty.
- **Timer and Score Tracking**: Keep track of your time and score as you progress through the game.
- **Interactive GUI**: Intuitive graphical user interface built using Java FX.
- **Dynamic Grid Size**: The game adjusts grid size and number of mines based on difficulty level.
- **Win/Loss Detection**: Displays a win/loss message based on game outcomes.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse IDE
- **Libraries**:
  - **Java FX**: Used for the graphical user interface (GUI) design.
  - **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: For handling graphics and user input.
